- [Instructor] To make the most out of this course, there are a few things that a learner should know like Java and Spring. We'll be modifying and changing several Java class files that use Spring, so it'll be helpful if you have a working knowledge of Java and the Spring framework or Spring Boot before taking this class. We'll be using JDK 17 and the latest version of IntelliJ Community Edition. Please have those downloaded and installed before you begin. With all that said, the code base presented for this series will not require extensive knowledge, but simply following the directions. As long as you can download the code base you should be able to follow along and learn all about Lombok. The exercise files for this course are available as zip. As you can see here, I've downloaded them to my desktop and unzipped them. Let's take a quick look at the layout. Inside of the folder, we see the Lombok directory and inside of it are all the chapter and lesson directories. Please do not move these folders outside of the original directory structure because chapter 3 project code will access the examples directory for a very basic text file that's used by a Spring Boot application. Each directory is labeled in a specific fashion to identify the chapter and lesson. So for chapter 1 lesson one, it is formatted as follows 0 1 0 1 begin Lombok demo. And just as there is a beginning, there's also an end. As with 0 1 0 1 end Lombok demo. You have a beginning state for the code and an ending state for what the code will look like at the end of each lesson. The only difference to this pattern are the challenge and solutions directories. When opening project code with IntelliJ, please ensure it to drill all the way down to the Lombok folder. Let me demonstrate. Going to click on the open folder, when the open folder directory dialogue appears we're going to drill down into the desktop, exercise files, learning Lombok, 0 1 0 1 Begin Lombok demo, and then open. This is important for IntelliJ, since the Gradle functionality in IntelliJ will read the Build Gradle file and begin loading the dependencies. For most folks taking this course, you probably didn't need all of that handholding so thank you for your patience. For everyone else, if you get lost or feel the need to re-download all the exercise files again and start over, please feel free to do so.
